Dear,

Hello, my name is Youssef Tawfik from Egypt. I study at INTI International University Bachelor of computer science specialization in software engineering a dual degree with Coventry University in UK. My current CGPA is 3.54, I want to continue my studies and pursue masters in your university. I will start my 3rd and final year in January 2022 and I will finish my degree by December 2022. It is pretty early for me to start applying but I wanted to know what is the steps for me to join the university, when I should apply, how much is it per year, if there are any scholarships you can offer due to my academic achievements and what should I know if I am going to enroll to the university. Thank you.

Regards,
Youssef Tawfik
